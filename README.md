### Stocks Application

#### Notes
Please make sure to read the [notes document](NOTES.md).

#### Getting started
For the sake of simplicity, the build process was designed to run from the root directory, and handle both back-end and front-end applications (since they are in the same repository).

Navigate to the repository's root directory and run the following commands:
```
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

The application is now running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

#### Unit tests
To run front-end unit tests, navigate to the root directory and run the following:
```$xslt
npm run test-frontend
```
